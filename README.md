## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned a lot about how to use flexbox and how to make a website responsive, but I didn't understand how to make the image that color ... I couldn't find a way to stylize the image with css, so I edited it in photoshop (I tried).
